## About This Oroject

- In this project, we performed a 3 different unsupervised clustering models `Hierarchical Clustering`, `K-means Clustering` and `Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)`on the customer's records. Customer segmentation is the practice of separating customers into groups that reflect similarities among customers in each cluster. We are trying to divide customers into segments to optimize the significance of each customer to the business. To modify products according to distinct needs and behaviours of the customers. It also helps the business to cater to the concerns of different types of customers.

- Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.

- Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.

## Data Investigation

## Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
- Exploring the dataset.
- Getting summary statistics. 
- Checking for null values and duplicated records.
- Applying some visualizations for more insights.
- Cleaning our dataset.
- Applying some feature engineering techniques trying to extract new features that help our model more to cluster better. 

## Applying Clustering Techniques
- Applying and visualizing three different clustering models:
  - `Hierarchical Clustering`.
  - `K-means Clustering`.
  - `Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)`.
## Dimensionality Reduction
Apllied using PCA to our features.

## Results
- Metrics Used: `silhouette_score`.
- Comparing our different clustering algorithms, we found that applying K-means algorithm after applying PCA, give us the best result in segmentation.
